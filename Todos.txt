buying portal:
display the five teams... clicking on any one of the teams should display the players in that team. Clicking on any one of the players should take you to the player info page.
So I need five buttons. Clicking on any one of them displays 13 additional buttons.
	player info
	displays info about the player and one button to buy that player.
selling portal
display all players owned by that player, clicking should sell that player. So number of buttons should be a runtime parameter
fixtures and results
just display the matches
view info
just display player info
points table
just display points table..

On top of each screen should be five buttons, one each for : buying portal, selling portal, view info, fixtures and results and points table.
